# ArduinoWebLedStripControl
 My poor implementation of a web led controler 

This uses a static IP of 192.168.227.100 by default 
if you want to change the IP near the top of the file are the settings
if you dont want a static IP comment out #define STATICIP 1

this code works with my random knock off strip results may vary
